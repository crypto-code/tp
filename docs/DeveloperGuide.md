  <h1> CohortConnect v1.4 </h1>

  <b> Type. Explore. Connect. </b>
</div>

CohortConnect is an advanced desktop address book which facilitates networking among Computer Science (CS) students. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Manage large groups of contacts with advanced features such as **Import** for a quick 1-step setup, marking your **Favourite** contacts, as well as finding contacts going to the same **Event**. CohortConnect also makes it easy to connect with like-minded students in your module. Our **Find A Buddy** feature matches you with students who have similar interests by leveraging GitHub’s metadata using a proprietary algorithm.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Implementation

This section describes noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Telegram

#### Implementation

The telegram handle field is facilitated by the `Telegram` class. It is stored interally as a `String` in the data file `addressbook.json` and is then initialized as a `Telegram` object. 

The `Telegram` class implements the following operation:

* `Telegram#isValidTelegram(String test)` — Returns true if a given string is a valid telegram handle.

Regex used in verifying the validity of telegram handle:

`public static final String VALIDATION_REGEX = "\\w{5,32}";`
* `\w` — **Word**. Any word character (alphanumeric & underscore)
* `{5,32}` — **Quantifier**. Match between 5 and 32 of the preceding token.

The `Telegram` class is first integrated into the `Person` class and added as a new field to the `Person` class. This is illustrated by the class diagram below, where every field, including the `Telegram` field, is compulsory except the `Tag` field.

![PersonWithTelegramClassDiagram](images/PersonWithTelegramClassDiagram.png)

### Optional Fields

#### Implementation

The `Phone`, `Email` and `Address` fields were modified such that these fields are no longer compulsory. The class diagram below illustrates the `Person` class after the addition of the `Telegram` field. The `Name` and `Telegram` fields are compulsory while the rest are optional.

![PersonOptionalFieldClassDiagram](images/PersonOptionalFieldClassDiagram.png)

In order to accomodate to the above mentioned new optional fields, the respective constructors were modified such that the following examples are considered valid inputs.

Example 1: Adding new contact without email and address.

```
add n/John Doe te/@johndoe123 p/98765432 
```

Example 2: Adding new contact without phone, email and address.

```
add n/John Doe te/@johndoe123
```

A more interesting input would be as such.

Example 3: Adding new contact without email and address but with empty phone input.

```
add n/John Doe te/@johndoe123 p/
```

In such a case, the constructors are modified such that the above input is also deemed as valid. The rationale behind this is that there is nothing for the `VALIDATION_REGEX` to verify, unlike in the following example.

Example 4: Adding new contact without email and address but with invalid phone input.

```
add n/John Doe te/@johndoe123 p/invalidPhoneNumber
```

For the case above, the respective constructors will carry out validation on the given input.

In order to allow for optional fields, the `AddCommandParser` also has to be modified. In particular, the following methods are modified
* `AddCommandParser#arePrefixesPresent(argumentMultimap, prefixes)`
* `AddCommandParser#parse(args)`

For the `arePrefixesPresent` method, the prefixes provided were changed to only include the following mandatory fields:
* `PREFIX_NAME`
* `PREFIX_TELEGRAM`

`AddCommandParser#arePrefixesPresent(argumentMultimap, prefixes)` uses the static parsing methods in `ParserUtil` to parse the different fields in `Person`. The individual fields are first initialised with an empty string, which is now a valid input. The method then calls the `arePrefixesPresent` method to check if the provided prefix is present. If present, the method will then call the respective static parsing methods in `ParserUtil`.

### GitHub

#### Implementation

The GitHub field is facilitated by the `Github` class. It is stored interally as a `String` in the data file `addressbook.json` and is then initialized as a `Github` object. 

The `Github` class implements the following operation:

* `Github#isValidGithub(String test)` — Returns true if a given string is a valid GitHub username.

Regex used in verifying the validity of GitHub username:

`public static final String VALIDATION_REGEX = "[a-zA-Z\d](?:[a-zA-Z\d]|-(?=[a-zA-Z\d])){0,38}";`
* `[a-zA-Z\d]` — **Character set**. Match any character in the set.
* `a-z` — **Range**. Matches a character in the range "a" to "z" (char code 97 to 122). Case sensitive.
* `A-Z` — **Range**. Matches a character in the range "A" to "Z" (char code 65 to 90). Case sensitive.
* `\d` — **Digit**. Matches any digit character (0-9).
* `(?:[a-zA-Z\d]|-(?=[a-zA-Z\d]))` — **Non-capturing group**. Groups multiple tokens together without creating a capture group.
* `|` — **Alternation**. Acts like a boolean OR. Matches the expression before or after the sign.
* `-` — **Character**. Matches a "-" character (char code 45).
* `{0,38}` — **Quantifier**. Match between 0 and 38 of the preceding token.

The `Github` class is first integrated into the `Person` class and added as a new field to the `Person` class. This is illustrated by the class diagram below, where only the `Name`, `Telegram` and `Github` fields are compulsory.

![PersonWithGithubClassDiagram](images/PersonWithGithubClassDiagram.png)

### Export command

#### Implementation

The Export command accepts the name of a JSON file as a parameter, and exports the current list of contacts to the 
specified file. It is facilitated by the `ExportCommandParser` class, which implements `Parser<ExportCommand>`. 
It implements the `parse()` method, which parses the filename and returns an `ExportCommand`, to be executed in 
`LogicManager`.
 
The `ExportCommand` class extends `Command`. It stores the filename as a class variable and its implementation of
`Command#execute()` is where the generation of the JSON file begins. The current addressbook, is obtained by 
`Model#getAddressBook()`. A temporary instance of `JsonAddressBookStorage` is created by passing in the filename, and it
saves the current addressbook to the specified file name using the method `exportToJson()`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic`, `Storage` and `Model` components for 
the `execute("export newfriends.json")` API call.

![ExportSequenceDiagram](images/ExportSequenceDiagram.png)

### Find command

#### Implementation

The Find command accepts names, tags, Telegram handles or GitHub usernames as parameters with the following prefixes :
* no prefix : for names
* `t/` : for tags
* `te/` : for Telegram handles
* `g/` : for GitHub usernames

and allows users to search for contacts based on the specified criterion.
It is facilitated by the `FindCommandParser` class, which implements `Parser<FindCommand>`.
It implements the `parse()` method, which parses the find parameter (eg: name, tag, etc) and returns a `FindCommand`, to be executed in
`LogicManager`.

The `FindCommand` class extends `Command`. Its instance is created by providing a predicate (condition to be fulfilled by the elements of 
the `FilteredPersonList` that contains the contact(s) matching the find parameters). Its implementation of
`Command#execute()` is where the updation of the `FilteredPersonList` to reflect the search performed on the contacts in the address book.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` and `Model` components for
the `execute("find te/alex_1")` API call.

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

### Welcome Window

#### Implementation

The class `WelcomeWindow` is responsible displaying the welcome window at the
start, when the application is launched. It is facilitated by `WelcomeWindow.fxml` file
which is responsible for how various components inside this window are arranged.

The `WelcomeWindow` class extends `UiPart<Stage>`.

When the app is launched, an instance of this class is created, and the 
`WelcomeWindow#start` is invoked to display the window. Various methods
including `fadeTransition` and `displayAnimatedText` are used within this
class to achieve the fading image and character typing effect respectively.

![WelcomeWindowSequenceDiagram](images/WelcomeWindowSequenceDiagram.png)

### Show command

#### Implementation

The Show command accepts the index in list or name of a contact as a parameter, and shows all the details of the contact to the
Person Details Pane on the right-hand side of the screen. It is facilitated by the `ShowCommandParser` class, which implements `Parser<ShowCommand>`.
It implements the `parse()` method, which parses the index/name and returns a `ShowCommand`, to be executed in
`LogicManager`.

The `ShowCommand` class extends `Command`. It stores the index/name as a class variable and its implementation of
`Command#execute()` calls `Command#executeWithIndex()` or `Command#executeWithName()` based on whether parameter is index or name.

#### Implementation of `Command#executeWithIndex()`

This is called if the parameter is a parsable Integer. 
The method calls `model.setSelectedIndex(index)` which displays the details of the contact on the Details Pane.



The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic`, `Model` and `UI` components for
the `execute("show 5")` API call.

![ExportSequenceDiagram](images/ShowWithIndexSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Implementation of `Command#executeWithName()`

This is called if the parameter is **NOT** a parsable Integer.
The method calls `model.setSelectedIndex(index)` with index gotten from the `filteredList` which displays the details of the contact on the Details Pane.
If there are multiple contacts with names that contain the parameter keyword then a list of such persons are shown.
If there is no contact with name that contain the parameter keyword in the `filteredList`, then the entire addressbook is searched.


The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic`, `Model` and `UI` components for
the `execute("show alex")` API call.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. Data should be saved locally.
5. Product is not required to handle communication between users.


### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
* **Private contact detail**: A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others
* **Main Success Scenario (MSS)**: The most straightforward interaction for a given use case, which assumes that nothing goes wrong.
* **JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation, is a common file format which stores data in key-value pairs and arrays.

## Appendix: Instructions for manual testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.


### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.


### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. Navigate to and open `/data/addressbook.json` in a text editor.

   2. Delete one line of code from a Person object, such as `"tagged" : [ "friends" ]`

   3. Restart CohortConnect.

   4. CohortConnect will start with no contacts.

   5. An error message will be shown in the `ResultDisplay`, stating that the file is corrupted.
