# CohortConnect

> Type. Explore. Connect.

<br>
CohortConnect is an advanced desktop address book which facilitates networking among Computer Science (CS) students. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Manage large groups of contacts with advanced features such as **Import** for a quick 1-step setup, marking your **Favourite** contacts, as well as finding contacts going to the same **Event**. CohortConnect also makes it easy to connect with like-minded students in your module. Our **Find A Buddy** feature matches you with students who have similar interests by leveraging GitHubâ€™s metadata using a proprietary algorithm.
